The code to be run is present in the folder "assignment-1"

Since the set up for running a cpp file has been made for the first time in my vscode, a ".vscode" folder is also present in the folder
Kindly remove the ".vscode" folder before running in case cpp has already been set up in your system, or another platform is being used other than vscode 

## Description:
- The folder "include" contains the classes and their respective members and methods present as individual files, which are included in the main function as header files for execution
- The folder "src" contains the source code for the execution of the members and methods in the classes
- The "main" file in the src folder contains the main() function to be executed for reviewing the desired output and working of each class
